# Trailersflix

A fullstack application made for movie lovers who want a one stop shop that will
help that track and watch the trailers of their favorite movies.

## Why I Built This

I made this application because I wanted to create a movie app that I would use.
One that also has functionality beyound just liking and unliking movies. I wanted
a place where someone can track their favorites but also watch a trailer to see if
they'd like it. I also wanted to use TailwindCSS, so styling with inspiration from
Netflix's UI helped me get a grasp on that technology.
